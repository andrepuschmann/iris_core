/*!
*   \brief The PhyDataBuffer class implements a buffer which exists between two IRIS components within a single
*  PhyEngine.
*
*  The buffer consists of a number of DataSet objects which can be written and read by the components.
*  Components can get a DataSet to write to by calling GetWriteSet(). When finished writing, the component
*  releases the DataSet by calling ReleaseWriteSet().
*  Components can get a DataSet to read from by calling GetReadSet(). When finished reading, the component
*  releases the DataSet by calling ReleaseReadSet().
*  The PhyDataBuffer is NOT thread-safe. It should only be used within a single PhyEngine. It is non-blocking.
*  If a component wishes to write more data sets than are available, the PhyDataBuffer will grow.
